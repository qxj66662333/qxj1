# Tango with Django 2 Codebase
This is a model solution for the *Tango with Django 2* book. Included are model solutions to all of the exercises included through each chapter. Screenshots that appear in the book were taken from a browser when executing this code.

If you notice something that doesn't work -- or you think there's a better way to solve something -- it would be great to hear from you. Add an [*Issue*](https://github.com/maxwelld90/tango_with_django_2_code/issues) to this repository, and myself of Leif will get back to you!

Everything is working as of July 23, 2019.

**Note:** if you are a student looking for a quick way to complete your Rango assignment, you should be aware that there are a few little things in here which, if you blindly copy and paste, will demonstrate that you did just that. You have been warned. It's always better to spend your time actually learning about what everything does -- rather than blindly copying and pasting someone else's work, and flogging it off as your own. Have fun!
